    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li>
        <li>1 pound phyllo dough</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/3 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Lightly grease a 9x13 pan and set the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Thaw the phyllo dough according to manufacturer's directions 
            (this may take overnight). When thawed, roll out the dough and cut 
            the dough in half so the sheets will fit in the pan. Cover with a damp 
            towel to keep it from drying out.</li>
        <li>Process the nuts until in small, even sized pieces. Combine with 
            sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. In a separate bowl, melt the butter 
            in the microwave. </li>
        <li>Spoon on a thin layer of the nut mixture. Cover with two more sheets 
            of phyllo, brushing each one with butter. Continue to repeat the nut 
            mixture and two buttered sheets of phyllo until the nut mixture is all 
            used up. The top layer should be 8 phyllo sheets thick, each sheet being 
            individually buttered. Do not worry if the sheets crinkle up a bit, it
            will just add more texture. </li>
        <li>Cut into 24 equal sized squares using a sharp knife. Bake at 350°F for 
            30-35 minutes or until lightly golden brown, and edges appear slightly 
            crisp. </li>
        <li>Spoon the cooled syrup over the hot baklava and let cool for at least 
            4 hours. Garnish with some finely crushed pistachios of desired. </li>


    </ol>
